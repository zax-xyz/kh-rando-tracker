p The item will become activated, lighting up to full opacity.
p When clicking on a world more than once, if applicable, a number will appear in the bottom right indicating how many visits have been completed. Drive, magic, and summons have similar systems for levels.
p After all visits have been completed, clicking again will either trigger a symbol to appear in the top left, for defeat of the Data Org/Absent Sillhouette fight, or reset the cell back to its original state.
p.footnote Note: 'Visits' for Atlantica/100 Acre Wood represent not whole world completion but segment completion. That is, song completion for Atlantica (including the tutorial), and pages for 100 Acre Wood.
p.footnote Note: The counter for Sora's Level will increase in increments of +1 from LV1-15, then +5 from LV15-50 and +10 from LV50-99.
